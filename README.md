# WEB322 Term Project
A company management application built using MongoDB, PostgreSQL, ExpressJs, NodeJs and ORM wrappers utilizing bootstrap layouts and handlebars as our rendering engine.

# To Run
Clone this repo and first do `npm install` to install dependencies. Inside `data-service.js` and `data-service-auth.js`, add your database credentials to link to your databases. Inside `server.js` I've provided a link to the Heroku app, which will likely take 30 seconds or so because the server will have to first boot up.
